# Airline - Change Log

## 0.8

- Forked from upstream repository
    - Group ID changed to `com.github.rvesse`
    - Currently package names remain same as upstream (bar the help system) to make it easy to migrate existing apps to this fork.  
    - **Please note** that future releases will change the package names to align with the Group ID.
- Annotation improvements
    - `Option` improvements:
        - `allowedValues` properties is actually enforced and produces `ParseOptionIllegalValueException` if an invalid value is received
        - New `override` and `sealed` properties allowing derived commands to change some properties of the annotation
        - Overridden options may change the type when it is a narrowing conversion
        - New `completionBehaviour` and `completionCommand` properties allowing defining behaviours for the purposes of completion script generators
    - `Arguments` improvements
        - New `completionBehaviour` and `completionCommand` properties allowing defining behaviours for the purposes of completion script generators
    - `Group` annotation for specifying groups
    - `Command` annotation supports discussion and examples
- Help system improvements
    - Most portions moved to `io.airlift.airline.help` package
    - Help printing respects new lines allowing them to be used in longer descriptions
    - Support for additional examples and discussion sections in command help
    - Abstracted out help generation into interfaces with multiple concrete implementations:
        - Command Line (the existing help system)
        - [Ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/)
        - HTML
